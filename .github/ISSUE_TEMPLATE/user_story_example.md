# User Story

**As a** regular customer
**I** would like to be able to view my order history,  
**to** be able to place repeated orders for my favorite products more quickly.

---

## Description

The user should have access to a clear order history in which all past orders are displayed. Each order should contain detailed information such as order date, items included, quantities and the total amount. In addition, it should be possible to filter orders by date and status (e.g. delivered, in progress) in order to quickly find relevant orders. This function should only be available for logged-in users to ensure the privacy and security of the data.

## Acceptance criteria
